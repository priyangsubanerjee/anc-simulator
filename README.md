## ANC Simulator

A browser-based interactive demo that visualizes how **sound waves** can cancel each other through phase inversion. Using the Web Audio API, two sine oscillators are generated with adjustable frequency, phase shift, and gain inversion.

### Features

- Interactive tone generator using the Web Audio API  
- Adjustable **frequency** and **phase shift** sliders  
- Optional **wave inversion** with negative gain  
- Real-time waveform visualization (original, inverted, and sum)  
- Simple, responsive UI built with React & Tailwind CSS
